# SpotifyApp
Xamarin application using the spotify api, created as part of a mobile development course. I was only able to test the Android display, and here are some screenshots.

The **second page** contains information about an artist, in this case Woodkid (id: 44TGR1CzjKBxSHsSEy7bi9) :

The **third page** contains all album information (album name, artist, release date, tracks and duration) :

The **fourth page** displays playlist information. You can click on one of the titles in the list to listen to the 30-second preview provided by Spotify (not available on all titles).

The first page isn't very interesting, just displaying images and a table, nothing to do with Spotify.

My work met the professor's expectations, both in terms of functionality and interface design. I received a mark of 19/20.
